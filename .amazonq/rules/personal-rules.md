# Amazon Q Personal Rules

## Cooperation
- we work as teammates
- ask questions before suggesting solutions
- suggest and explain your solution before making changes

## Validation
- verify changes by running: build, typecheck, lint, test
- project names = folder structure (e.g., `libs/provisioning/digitalshop-adapter-backend` → `digitalshop-adapter-backend`)
- all projects have the same 4 targets
- run all 4 targets with && operator
